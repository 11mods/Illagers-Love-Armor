# Armorful

Armorful adds armor for various mobs naturally where vanilla does not. It adds armor to illagers during raids and patrols, and allows Drowned to spawn with armor.

It's a Fabric port of [Illagers Wear Armor](https://modrinth.com/mod/illagers-wear-armor), just with a few slight tweaks, bug fixes and new features.

## Illagers (Pillagers)

Illagers have a chance to naturally spawn with armor, and an increased chance during a raid depending on the difficulty and the wave number.

- Evoker
- Illusioner
- Pillager
- Vindicator
- Vexes

## Drowned

Drowned can now have a chance to naturally spawn with armor depending on the difficulty of the world.
